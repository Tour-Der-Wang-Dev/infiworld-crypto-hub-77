# Folder Structure Recommendations

After auditing the current project structure, here are some recommendations to improve the organization and scalability of the codebase.

## Current Structure

```
src/
├── components/         # UI components
├── hooks/              # Custom hooks
├── integrations/       # External service integrations
├── lib/                # Utility libraries
├── pages/              # Page components
├── utils/              # Helper utilities
└── App.tsx             # Main application component
```

## Recommendations

### 1. Feature-based Organization

Consider reorganizing components into feature-based modules instead of just by component type. This approach is more scalable as the application grows:

```
src/
├── features/               # Feature-based modules
│   ├── auth/               # Authentication feature
│   │   ├── components/     # Auth-specific components
│   │   ├── hooks/          # Auth-specific hooks
│   │   ├── utils/          # Auth-specific utilities
│   │   └── types.ts        # Auth-related type definitions
│   │
│   ├── marketplace/        # Marketplace feature
│   │   ├── components/     # Marketplace-specific components
│   │   ├── hooks/          # Marketplace-specific hooks
│   │   ├── utils/          # Marketplace-specific utilities
│   │   └── types.ts        # Marketplace-related type definitions
│   │
│   ├── payments/           # Payments feature
│   │   ├── components/     # Payment-specific components
│   │   ├── hooks/          # Payment-specific hooks
│   │   ├── utils/          # Payment-specific utilities
│   │   └── types.ts        # Payment-related type definitions
│   │
│   ├── map/                # Map feature
│   │   └── ...             # Same structure
│   │
│   ├── freelance/          # Freelance feature
│   │   └── ...             # Same structure
│   │
│   └── reservations/       # Reservations feature
│       └── ...             # Same structure
│
├── shared/                 # Shared resources used across features
│   ├── components/         # Shared UI components
│   │   ├── ui/             # Basic UI elements (shadcn)
│   │   └── layout/         # Layout components
│   │
│   ├── hooks/              # Shared hooks
│   ├── utils/              # Shared utility functions
│   └── types/              # Shared TypeScript interfaces and types
│
├── integrations/           # External service integrations
├── pages/                  # Page components (could be moved into features)
├── App.tsx                 # Main application component
└── main.tsx                # Entry point
```

### 2. Consolidate Similar Utilities

Currently, there are utility functions in both `src/utils/` and `src/lib/`. Consider consolidating these:

```
src/
├── utils/                  # All utility functions
│   ├── common/             # General utilities
│   ├── security/           # Security-related utilities
│   ├── formatting/         # Formatting utilities
│   └── validation/         # Validation utilities
```

### 3. State Management

As the application grows, consider adding a dedicated state management structure:

```
src/
├── store/                  # Global state management
│   ├── auth/               # Authentication state
│   ├── marketplace/        # Marketplace state
│   └── ...                 # Other state slices
```

### 4. Testing Structure

Mirror the source code structure for tests:

```
src/
├── features/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── __tests__/      # Tests for auth feature
│   │   │   ├── components/ # Tests for auth components
│   │   │   └── hooks/      # Tests for auth hooks
```

### 5. Routing Organization

Consider organizing routes more clearly:

```
src/
├── routes/                 # Routing configuration
│   ├── ProtectedRoutes.tsx # Protected route definitions
│   ├── PublicRoutes.tsx    # Public route definitions
│   └── index.tsx           # Main router configuration
```

## Migration Plan

To implement these changes without disrupting development:

1. **Phase 1**: Create the new folder structure alongside the existing one
2. **Phase 2**: Gradually move components into the new structure, updating imports
3. **Phase 3**: Update tests to reflect new file locations
4. **Phase 4**: Remove the old structure once migration is complete

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Scalability**: Better organization for adding new features
2. **Discoverability**: Easier for new developers to understand the codebase
3. **Encapsulation**: Feature-specific code stays together
4. **Maintenance**: Improved ability to update or replace individual features
5. **Testing**: Clearer structure for organizing tests

## File Naming Conventions

Consider adopting consistent naming conventions:

- React components: PascalCase (e.g., `ButtonComponent.tsx`)
- Hooks: camelCase prefixed with "use" (e.g., `useAuth.ts`)
- Utility functions: camelCase (e.g., `formatCurrency.ts`)
- Type definitions: PascalCase with a meaningful suffix (e.g., `UserTypes.ts`, `PaymentInterfaces.ts`)

## Implementation Priority

1. First, move shared UI components to `shared/components`
2. Next, organize the payment feature as it's well-contained
3. Then, organize auth-related functionality
4. Finally, tackle the marketplace, freelance, and map features
